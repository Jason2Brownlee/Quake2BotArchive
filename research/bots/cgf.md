## Announcement

> March 30, 1999
>
> Welcome to the CGF for ActionQ2 site. All the info on the upcoming ActionQ2 bots, illustrated by lots of screen shots!
> Alas, no bots to download yet, but I'm making steady progress (and have reduced my AQ2 on-line hours :( to spend more time with the bots).
> Expect to hear a release date in the first week of May.
>
> I aim to update the site every week, to keep you posted on the progress. Meanwhile, have a look at the ideas behind CGF and the planned features.
>
> This site wouldn't be here without the help of Telefragged (the big mama for many of the ActionQ2 sites), the input and design of Cube (site, logo and the action flick style image rotation in the sidebar), and the many gamers who sent encouraging emails and offered support.
>

> 7th April 1999 - CGF site hosted.
>
> Again apologies. While John seems to be sucked into real life AI work (or busy waiting for the Half-Life SDK :)), I've been too busy as well...
As a result, now present at this site is my ongoing work on a combination of bots, missions, tactics and scripting for Action Quake2 : CGF.

## v0.77

Released as `cgf_0_77.zip`.

Mentioned on the CGF homepage:

> July 8, 1999
>
> CGF 0.77 beta has arrived. It's still a long way to accomplish what I've set out to do, but we're getting somewhere.
You can fetch the beta here, at 1.2MB (Windows only).
>
> Please spend your time (while waiting for the beta to be downloaded) by reading these release notes carefully.
>
> When you have questions, please consult the AQ2 message board first (and read the relevant postings before submitting the questions). I'll give priority to answering questions there (over replying my email).

>
> Computer Generated Forces for Action Quake2 has posted beta 0.77 of their new modification that adds AI bot teammates (and enemies) to Action Quake2. The first release includes two missions for the Urban map, and more detail can be found in the release notes. Thanks Devo. Speaking of Action Quake, the Action Quake1project is underway, looking to add a classic Quake version of this popular Quake II mod (also currently under construction for Half-Life).

Mentioned on the Action Quake2 homepage:

> Friday, July 09th

> Secondly, and just as exciting, is the release of the first bot to be compatible with Action Quake2. It is hard to explain and it is in beta, so I will just give a link and let the author tell it like it is. Don't expect an eraser bot though, this is completely different stuff here. http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf/ . It is serendipitous if you think about it. The bot being released so near an Action Player Model contest will mean that many more avatars to portray the bots once the contest ends.

## v0.78

Released as:

* `cgf_0_78.zip`.
* `cgf_0_78u.zip`.

Mentioned on the CGF homepage:

> July 17, 1999
>
> As mentioned in the previous update, I just don't have much time for CGF this month. Because of that, the new beta 0.78 contains few modifications, but essential modifications for the new map supported: Ruskprick's city. However, most reported bugs haven't been fixed1.
> Two small sets of missions are supplied as well: one, in which you (as a 'counter'sniper) assist a four men attack force to clear City's rooftops. Another, in which you just need to survive on City's streets.
>
> You can count on the various mission sites (see the links page) to offer new missions for City in about two days.
>
> In case you're in doubt whether or not to download 2.3MB (or the smaller upgrade), here's Oswald's review.
>
> I wish you all a lot of fun with the upcoming Action Half Life (late July).
>
> William
>
> 1: normally I don't make more changes than I can test. Most bug fixes just had to be postponed because I lack the time to test them: whereas AQ2 source code is about 38,000 (38K) lines of code (LOC), CGF for AQ2 adds 58KLOC, thus totalling 96KLOC. Every planned change should be made in such a way that it is consistent with all assumptions made in the existing (lines) of code. For example, 'just' reducing the vision qualities of the bot (something that needs to be done) affects lots of other behavior (aiming, patrol behavior, etc.), and affects just too much to test right now.

Mentioned on the Action Quake2 homepage:

> Tuesday, July 27th
>
> Old news for most of you who care, but there has been a newer version of CGF released that works with 2 maps instead of one now.

## v0.79

?

## v0.80

Released as `cgf_0_80.zip`.

Mentioned on the CGF homepage:

> November 28, 1999
>
> After a lengthy period of training, here is CGF 0.80. Bringing better tactics, new map support, extra weapons, documentation, and above all... more action!
>
> I personally am fond of the new missions:
>
> * assaulting a well defended building at Riot (see left image above)
> * defending the L-Mart at Coverme (where about 5 windows get broken in the first 30 seconds)
> * infiltrating and clearing the p1_lightbeam lighthouse complex
>
> The new supply of weapons (and weapon sounds) adds to the chaos of squad-on-squad engagements.
You can read all about the CGF 0.80 features both here and in the release notes.
>
> Please read the download and release instructions carefully. And beware of the 5 minute number crunching preceding the first missions on a new map (CGF seems to hang but instead is working hard for you).
>
> William

## v0.81

Released as:

* `cgf_0_81.zip`
* `cgf_0_81u.zip`

Mentioned on the CGF homepage:

> December 25, 1999
>
> Ho ho ho ho. Santa Claus brings us CGF 0.81 with bug-fixes, CGF multi-player test-code and support for RiotX.
>
> The bugs that have been fixed include:
>
> * appearance of blue/green balls and male/reservoir models ('men in black')
> * fixed echo-ing of 'enemyd' and 'enemys' sounds when issued by player
> * fixed picking up of 'old school' cannon (weapon wasn't selected after picking up)
> * fixed VWEP representation when bot switches weapon
> * terrain computations are post-poned until mission start, so a warning now can appear on-screen
> * close-combat bot behavior has been made more aggressive
> * movement tweaks to deal with low portals preceded by <8 unit thresholds (urban2 and all windows at riotx)
> * player name substitutions now work; mission objectives can refer to the mission name of the player whereas the player keeps his name
>
> In addition, CGF 0.81 contains test code for multi-player CGF. Since I solely have a single PC at my disposal, thoroughly testing multi-player code is tough for me (see image above). In other words, I'm solliciting feedback from you.
You can find the info on how to run CGF in multi-player mode here.
>
> To add an X-mass touch to this release, and more importantly, to enable CGF to visit one of the best AQ2 maps ever, RiotX "Jingle Balls Special" by Ellusion is now supported. RiotX may initially look like a snow covered Riot: Gangbang conversion, but you'll soon discover that this map extends Riot with an impressive amount of (demanding) jumps and new routes, a gloomy atmosphere, and a musical touch. Get it here.
>
> The two series of RiotX missions have been designed with CGF (co-op) multi-player in mind (they also work fine as single-player missions, but may be a bit challenging).
>
> My plans for CGF now include:
>
> * improving bot movement so the bots can deal with natural terrain as in the jungle and cliff maps
> * tackle button operated doors
> * retro-fitting a number of AQ2 1.52 features
> * experiments with 'func_train' vehicles (not sure if this results in something useful)
>
> Enjoy your holidays!
>
> William
