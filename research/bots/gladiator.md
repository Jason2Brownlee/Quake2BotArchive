> Gladiator bot v0.96 released.....

> For a quick download go here. Linux version will be forthcoming.
>
> This might be the final release of the Gladiator bot for Quake 2. It has something to do with the old story "we just haven't got the time anymore". Mr. Freeze is in the process of getting a new job and setting up & running a new football team here in Amsterdam (probably Amsterdam Warriors... shameless plug here). Squatt artistic ambitions have surfaced again; he has picked up the good ol' paintbrush and easel and bought himself a new camera. Mr. Elusive has to take some exams, start a new year at university and will probably do some other stuff as well. Maybe we'll still fix a few bugs....but that's a big "maybe". So far it has been lots of fun developing the Gladiator bot. Thanks you all for the great support, sending comments, pointing at problems and helping out in general!

> There are still lots of unanswered e-mails in MrE's mail box. He probably won't be able to answer them before we go on vacation but he does intend to check them out and send back a reply.

> Version 0.96 of the Gladiator Bot is now available, described as what may indeed be the final release of this AI playmate for Quake II. Thanks [utF] Stakker. Interestingly, The Shugashack points out that there's an "elusive.cfg" in the Q3ATest .pak file, leading to speculation that the author of the Gladiator (and Quake 1's Omicron bot), Mr Elusive, may be involved in the Q3A process in some way.
