## Ace II

Mentioned on BotEpidemic:

> Wednesday 6th January '99
>
> ACE II News/Demo  update by cube\
>Yesterday 3ZB II, today ACE II. Steve Yeager sent this info on what he's been doing over the holidays:

>> ACE II
>>
>> - Built on 3.20 src.
>> - CTF support.
>> - Full client emulation.
>> - New navigation method, very fast and supports the 64 player maps with ease.
>> - New movement code.
>> - New goal decision logic.
>>
>> Basically, I took apart the original ACE source and rebuilt the parts that I thought really sucked. The navigation and movement code were complete rewritten to accommodate a new method I developed (which can be read about on BotAid). No more slowdowns on the larger maps, and the accuracy of the ACE bot's movement are vastly improved. I also simplified the goal selection and combat AI so they basically work as well as the original ACE, but will allow better functions to be dropped in to improve the bots abilities. Probably the best news is that I will be releasing the source code once the last few bugs are cleaned up. That's right the entire source, which should allow anyone who wants to add ACE bots to their mods very simple, or to create all new bots based on ACE. The ACE bot source hooks into the original id source with only about 15 simple id source code changes. As for a release date all I can say is "Real Soon Now".

> And if that wasn't enough Steve also sent along a demo for posting, which you can get hold of here.
