> Oak2 Beta Test (Exclusive)\
> The Bot Epidemic Team has been fortunate enough to beta test the upcoming Oak2 Bot.
>
> The official public release of the Oak2 Bot will be in around 3 weeks.. so don't hold your breath.. yet! My first impressions after playing the bot for a couple of minutes was that this bot easily has the potential to grasp some of the Eraser/CRBot monopoly on the bot scene.. I will be doing a complete preview on the Oak2 bot over the next few days so stay tuned.

Speaking of Oak II, its own page reports that the first version should be out a few days after the source release of version 3.13 (unknown how the new ability to make mods work with 3.13 influences this tentative date just yet).

Mentioned on BotEpidemic:

> Tuesday 10th March '98 GMT
>
> Oak II Released\
> The first public alpha of the Oak Bot for Quake II has been released over on the Oak page.
> Here's what John Crickett had to say about it:
>
>> "Well I`m finally going to release Oak II, its far from complete, and theres so much I still want to do but I cant put this off for ever :). So without further ado wander over to the downloads page and grap yourself Oak II Version 0.1.
>
> PLEASE NOTE:
>
>> I`ve changed a few things recently, specifically the Bot Epidemic chaps pointed out it used the "proper" Quake2 scoreboard, which it I have just removed, a) because with the bots not being clients it doesnt work too well, and b) to add team scores etc into it, though I havent done this yet.
>> Oak II can play on ANY level, and the more they play on that level the better they will become, so long as you save the pathfile.
>> To speed up the pathing I dramatically increased the path file size, with the intention of following Ridahs lead, and using the Info-Zip Zip/UnZip dlls to compress the path files, however the dlls/example code I got hold of is contradictory and I`m having a few problems with it, so if anyone has used them, or anyting like them and can send me some working code do feel free, I`d be most grateful. Especially as the path files compress by about 95%!
>
> Ok, so what can you expect next? Firstly providing I see Steve on the net tonight I`ll see if hes made any changes to ACE.lib since I`ve been away, and then add ACE to Oak II and release a combined build for tomorrow, providing there are no conflicts. After that I`ll be spending this week getting the CTF version of Oak II ready, though it may take a little longer than I`d hoped."

## v0.1a

Released as:

* `OakII_01a.zip`

Mentioned on BotEpidemic:

> Wednesday 11th March '98 GMT
>
> New Fixed Oak\
>John has updated the Oak page with the following news:
>
>> "I`m sorry to say I wont have the CTF version ready for a couple of days yet, and the first version wont use the grapple.. However work on it is going well. I`ve also made a few changes to Oak II such as adding fast weapons switching as a option. I decided to do this after reading a email David 'crt' Wright (Rocket Arena) sent to the planetquake mailing list, as he points out its a nice option for people to have and he posted the few changes required to the list, so its not like it took me any effort :). Ok a few bugs have come to light and so theres a quick bug fix (Oak II Version 0.1a) available in the downloads section. I`d also like to thank Marcus Davies for his help/inablility to run away fast enough when I decide to bounce ideas off him. He's spent a fair number of hours recently providing Oak II with some invaluable things I was never going to get around to otherwise because of Real Life. Marcus is the man behind swimming, and has been known to suffer hours of GBH to the earhole about optimising pathing rountines, tweaking id's MoveToGoal, and figuring out why I spend so much each month on coffee... He drinks it all! Git! :)"

> You can download the new patch for the bot here. You'll need the original version to use this patch.

For those of you that dont know Spartan Arena is a new mod he is developing with DrCrypt that is similar to Rocket Arena but is suppossed to have new features and be even better.
