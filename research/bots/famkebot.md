## v1.5

Mentioned on the Famkebot homepage:

> 12-20-97:\
> 12:35 am (EST): I just released the latest version. It doesn't have TOO much fixed, but I'm releasing it anyway, to hold everyone over. Enjoy.\
> 8:50 am (EST): A solution for everyone (including myself) who is getting a client crash after ending a round or closing Q2 while using the bot with 3dfx enabled...get the updated Q2 3dfx driver. It fixed the problem for me.\
> 3:40 pm (EST): I fixed the "FIXME" thing that was left in the original source code that made it so the player bodies don't fall. They now fall just fine. :) I also added the line of code needed to the bot respawn function to make the bot's body stay after the bot dies.

## v1.6

Released as `famkebot150.zip` (wrong filename).

Mentioned on the Famkebot homepage:

> 12-21-97:\
> 1:30 am (EST): I got some mail from someone asking me to link to their page. Don't send me mail like that, because I won't be adding links from now on. However, I'm gonna stick a link to his page in here just to be nice. http://www.geocities.com/timessquare/arcade/2840...there ya go, Chris. :) Remember, NO MORE MAIL ASKING FOR A LINK FROM MY PAGE! :) Of course, you can link to my page from your page if you want. :) BTW, I haven't been to the page myself. Don't complain to me if you don't like something about it, complain to him instead. :)\
> 3:00 am (EST): ARRRRGH! I just got on ICQ with 50 "You have been added to this user's contact list" messages waiting for me. Please understand if I don't get back to you. :) Try to use e-mail from now on.\
> 4:20 am (EST): Forgot to mention, PlanetQuake gave my bot a spot in their news page. :)\
> 12:30 pm (EST): I put version 1.60 up, which is now being "verified" by OpenQuake (a service which checks Q2 mods to make sure they don't include anything that could harm your system). I, of course, know that it's safe, but I could be lying as far as anyone knows. What they're doing, pretty much, is proving I'm not. :)\
> 3:00 pm (EST): OQ verified version 1.6...they have it as 1.5 on their page because of the readme, but it's actually 1.6. Anyway, don't worry about it, they currently have the latest version checked on their page. :) Get it from them if you want.\

> In case you haven't tried the Famkebot (now moved to Quake2.com), it's worth a look-see. Of course, it can't aim well and I couldn't even lead it to weapons, but hey, it's the firt bot and it'll probably get better.

## v2.0

Mentioned on the Famkebot homepage:

> 12-29-97:\
> 12:15 pm (EST): I started deleting old news and putting new news at the top of the page instead of the bottom. Got 2 requests to do that, so I figured I would. :) Also, I'll be releasing a new version of the bot very soon, so keep checking back.\
> 12:50 pm (EST): I just released the latest version, 2.0. The bots still aren't the smartest and can't pick up weapons/items, but they ARE much harder to kill. Their rate of fire is the same as the player's, and so is the damage they do. You should have a lot more fun with these. :) Note that this version HAS NOT been verified by OpenQuake yet, but I assure you it's completely safe. :)

## v2.1

Mentioned on the Famkebot homepage:

> 12-29-97:\
> ...\
> 1:20 pm (EST): I just uploaded v2.1. It fixes a small AI bug after respawning.\
> 1:40 pm (EST): I fixed the problem with the bot leaving a blood trail after being gibbed.

## v2.2

Released as `famkebot.zip`.

Mentioned on the Famkebot homepage:

> 12-31-97:\
> 12:05 pm (EST): I fixed the DLL so that it works with Windows NT. I'll be re-releasing v2.1 with the fix. If you don't have Windows NT, you shouldn't bother with re-downloading it.\
> 12:20 pm (EST): Just updated the zip file with the version that works under Windows NT. If you have Windows NT, get it, and it doesn't work, then please e-mail me and let me know.\
> 3:15 pm (EST): Got mail from someone with Win NT saying it STILL doesn't work. If you have NT and it DOES work, please e-mail me. Thanks.\
> 5:15 pm (EST): I hate to say it, but it looks like Ridah's bot is gonna kick the crap out of mine. :) I'll keep trying to make it the best I can, though. I don't think I'll be implimenting waypoints and stuff, 'cause that's an area I really lack knowledge in. I'm just gonna try to use a random roaming thing, and have the bots be attracted to items when they see them. They'll use strafing and stuff for combat situations. Even that is a bit far off, though. Anyway, I suggest checking out Ridah's bot. An alpha should be out soon, and it's definitely worth a look.\
> 6:00 pm (EST): I released v2.2 of the bot. Nothing is new except the ability to enable/disable "bot talk" (see the text file in the zip for details). The main reason I'm releasing it with hardly anything changed like this is because I THINK I've nailed the Win NT problem. If you still can't get it to work under NT, e-mail me.

Re-released:

> 1-2-98:\
> 2:20 pm (EST): I re-released 2.2 AGAIN. This time I'm almost SURE it will work under NT. :) If you still can't get it to, as always, please e-mail me.

Mentioned at the top of the page:

> Alright, it's here... the Famkebot, the first DeathMatch bot (that I know of) for Quake II. I hope to make the AI much better over the next month or two, and I'll also be adding a more player-like weapons system to the bot, so it can pick up weapons/ammo and will use them as it gets them. It currently only uses the laser thingy. You'll also need to set deathmatch to 1 by adding "+deathmatch 1" to your Q2 command line before using it...well, I guess I'll stop rambling and give you the link (v2.2).

Released as `famkebot.zip`.

Mentioned on the Famkebot homepage:

> 4-6-98
>
> 4:40 am (EST): Because I've reached version 5.0 and there are no visible problems, I've decided to release another version of the bot. This version doesn't use waypoints because I haven't gotten them working correctly yet (the code is still in there, but there are some lines that disable it and prevent the bot from looking for waypoints). You can get version 5.0 of the Famkebot here. There's a ton of bug fixes AND totally new features. Make sure you read the famke.txt file for information on how to use all the nifty new stuff. :)\
> 6:50 am (EST): I just finished redoing a lot of stuff on this web site. It's now optimized for 1024x768, also. Not too bad, considering I did it all in notepad. :)\
> 5:30 pm (EST): I just got a logo in the mail from staili@gnwmail.com and decided to use it. Better than that other one I slapped together. :)

## v5.6

Released as `famkebot.zip`.

Mentioned on the Famkebot homepage:

> 4-15-98
>
> 12:15 pm (EST): I think I've fixed all the bugs and stuff, and I've made some level info files for some of my favorite levels and included them in the zip. So, here's version 5.6 of the Famkebot. I'm pretty sure it's got all the crashing bugs worked out, but if it does crash on you, try disabling roaming. That'll probably fix it. Anyway, new to this version is the ability to learn levels from the player, save the level info the bots have learned to file (automatically) and automatically recall that information if a level they've played on before is loaded. There's also a new "practice" mode (you can read the details on that in famke.txt) and quite a load of bug fixes. I think that's it, but I probably forgot some stuff. Well, enjoy.

## v5.62

Released as `fb562upg.zip`.

Mentioned on the Famkebot homepage:

> 4-15-98
>
> ...\
> 8:45 pm (EST): I found a couple more bugs and fixed them, and you can download the upgrade to version 5.62 to fix them. It includes a fix to base1.frf and some fixes with bugs involving the bots following paths. Note that you MUST have v5.6 already to use the v5.62 upgrade.\
> 9:30 pm (EST): Forgot to mention, the 5.62 upgrade also has an addition to coop that I was working on before I noticed those bugs. Coop bots get angry at friendly fire now... heheh... if you don't like it, you can turn it off by also disabling bottalk.

Additional Credits : John Crickett, author of the Oak II bot, deserves lots
                     of thanks. He's done TONS to help me with the bot.
                     Also, thanks to Ridah, author of the Eraser bot, who
                     helped me a little when I first got started on this
                     bot. And thanks to Brian 'AceComb' McClelland for
                     designing levels with items on them so I could test
                     what the bots would do with them and not have to lead
                     the bots into the items on one of the normal levels or
                     make my own levels. :) Also (they just keep coming)
                     thanks to sATaN, because he wrote a chasecam tutorial.
                     I used it to see how you set the client's view to
                     another object (just used a few lines of code from the
                     whole giant tutorial :). Also (ahhh) thanks to the
                     author of VWep (because the Famkebot now supports
                     VWep).

File Name   : famkesrc.zip
Version     : 5.?
Date        : June 17, 1998
Author      : Rich Whitehouse (TheFatal1)

Credits     : Thanks to all news sites that've posted about the bot
              (Blue's News, Bot Epidemic, Redwood, and many others).
              Thanks to lotsa people for the additional code they
              provided. Most of them if not all are noted in the
              readme for the actual bot or in sections in the source
              by the code they wrote.

## 6.0

Released as `famke6.zip`.

Mentioned on the Famkebot homepage:

> 2-11-99
>
> 7:00 pm (EST): Well, believe it or not, there's now a new version of the Famkebot available. Except this one is entirely rewritten by yours truly. I've put about 45 hours in the past 5 days into this thing. It's probably not as good as some of the other bots out there now, but I felt the need to do it because I left the previous Famkebot in such a pitiful state. Here's a list of features in this version that come to mind:
>
> -Full server-side (ONLY) client emulation (which, I'm proud to say, I figured out all by myself... I decided to give it a go before using Alan's client emulation code).
> -Cooperative mode support (works quite well).
> -DeathMatch mode support (of course).
> -Use of NFR files to store waypoint data (New Famkebot Route... boy, that's original).
> -Bots are completely customizeable due to the fact that each one's user data is read directly from bots.cfg.
>
> There's lots of other neato things too, so take a looksy. It includes NFR files for several levels (NFR files are 20kb each, BTW... I could probably optimize it further with some sizeof's, but it's not like 20kb is actually BIG). Haffa fun weeta wabbit! Ha ha!
