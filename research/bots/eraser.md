## Pre-Release Demo

Released as:

* `ridahAI.zip`

Mentioned on Impact News:

> AI demo	. 	. 	Wednesay 31/12/97
>
> Here's something interesting.. for those curious as to how well this system works (I know there are skeptics out there), I've recorded a demo using the debugging system talked about yesterday. For those beginners out there, this should also help explain how route-nodes work. I've just finished fixing some problems with the nodes (it was a pretty complex issue, concerning jumps), and now it's on to adjusting the bots to work with the changes. Hopefully this'll be sorted out today, and with the weapons already functional we're still looking good for a public alpha later this week.
> To get the demo working, place the ridahAI.dm2 file into quake2\baseq2\demos, then from within Quake2, type: map ridahai.dm2.

> Eraser Bot Alpha 2\
> Alpha 2 of Ridah's Eraser Bot (1.6 MB) for Quake II has been released on the Impact Development Team page (thanks Zac Heismann), along with support for three external deathmatch maps, crdm1 (171 KB), ikdm1 (178 KB), and mpq1 (330 KB). Here is the lowdown:
>
>> I spent last night adding in bot configuration, via external files, which has worked out pretty cool. You can make up you're own bot names, specify which model/skin to use, and even specify individual abilities, like aiming accuracy, combat skills, aggressiveness, favourite weapon, etc. These have all been mildly implemented, but I intend on taking this stuff even further, to allow you to program in stuff like chat lines for individual bots or general chat, adding and leaving the game while in progress, so if a bot's getting it's ass whooped, it may leave and let another bot in.

Mentioned on Impact News:

> Eraser v0.4 BETA	. 	. 	Saturday 24/1/98
>
> Well, after a few days of fighting the most frustrating of issues, I feel relatively safe in announcing the first BETA installment of the Eraser Bot. Major work has gone into server-side control, with the ability to setup a dedicated server, that will automatically bring in bots to an empty game, and kick them off when things get crowded. Bot's will travel from map to map, just like any other player. Also implemented is Dynamic learning of maps, although this is dependant on Human movement, they don't learn themselves (it's a speed thing). Thanks to rkm and Zoid for help with the linux port!
This is a BETA release, this means bugs should be less frequent. If you find something out of the ordinary, I would appreciate being notified of the problem, as long as you make sure to describe the situation as best as possible. I also ask that you first read the latest TODO list, before mailing in bugs. Thanks.
>
> I have made a LOT of changes to the README.TXT, so PLEASE, make sure you check that out.
>
> One last note, the following major features are not yet implemented, and will cause AI problems (ie. I am aware):

> * Button triggers (buttons that activate platforms, doors, etc)
> * Water (swimming is still not implement properly, haven't had time to look at this yet)
> * Sideways moving platforms

> OK, this should be a LOT better. The dynamic learning problems turned out to be a rounding error in the new portal code. Took me a few hours to hunt down (since it didn't appear to be the problem, at first), but should be cool now. I had a quick test on kick, after deleting the .rt2 file, and I got got my ass tatooed all over the walls. Also fixed the bot_name command, and included the correct directory structure in the release archives, *phew*.

> Eraser Bot Problem\
> There seems to be a very large problem with the Eraser Bot Beta released this afternoon (if you consider something that wacks up your Quake II installation a problem). Though I had no signs from McAfee that there is anything malicious in the file, I have had reports that there was a virus according to some people's scanners. I will post more when I know it (including what to do to get your Quake II installation up again).

Mentioned on BotEpidemic:

> Wednesday 4 Feb '98 EST
>
> Eraser Bot v0.5 BETA (8:00 EST)\
> Below is the changes from v0.4a for v0.5:
>
> * Bot frags don't reset on new level
> * Incorporated MapMod code to enable map sequencing configuration (see readme.txt for instructions)
> * Wrote some new danger avoidance code, for rockets & grenades
> * worked on the player sighting code, trying to balance between intelligence and speed
> * further tweaking of combat AI, when to abort chasing enemy, etc
> * Don't chase a human with the RL & > 25 health
> * Optimizations
> * Fixed some changelevel problems
> * add "bot_auto_skill" setting, so that bot's skills are lowered/raised with each kill/death
> * Re-wrote movement physics, making use of the player movement functions. Solved a lot of irregularities, such as walking pu steep slopes, getting stuck in walls, etc. Hopefully the CPU hit won't be excessive.
> * Reduce MAX_NODES back to 512, seems to use up too much memory at 1024 !!! make sure ReadTrail() doesn't exceed new MAX_NODES setting !!!
> * "SZ_GetSpace overflow without allowoverflow set" still occurs (falling into lava?)
> * MAJOR fps slowdowns on some systems
> * CanPickupAmmo() not entirely accurate (was working, but result was ignored in RoamFindBestItem() )
> * Use "game_dir = gi.cvar ("game", "", 0);" instead of hard-coded "Eraser" directory
> * General AI debugging, bots appear to stop for no reason, then restart
> * Footstep/Jumping sounds
> * Add average ping to BOTS.CFG (just for looks)
> * Bot's don't pickup AMMO intelligently
>
> As you can see there is a lot of improvements from the previous version. Still on the TODO list is the following:
> * Camper flag generally makes bots hover around good weapons/items (Quad, mega armor
> * Bots should use hand grenades
> * Fix "notarget 1", and remove botdebug from preventing bot's finding enemies
> * Investigate timelimit problem in linux
> * Bot fleeing AI needs work (also running away from player with Quad)
> * hipdm2 crashes server while learning map
> * Move to second map, after playing first map >5mins, access violation?
> * Death in mid-air, body floats in air
> * PATHS: don't drop jumping node, when taking damage upon falling, or falling into damage brush (ala hipdm2)
>
> Stop reading and start fragging! :)

And:

> VIRUS???? Eraser Bot v0.5 BETA (9:00 EST)\
> Sorry folks! I have taken down the Eraser Bot v0.5 links due to a virus scare.. It appears that there is some kind of major problem with the release. More news on this soon.

And:

> VIRUS? Installer Bug? Eraser Bot v0.5 BETA (10:30 EST)\
> Got this message from Randar explaining the Eraser v0.5 "virus":
>
> "Actually it does NOT appear to be a virus (I ran the exe through three virus programs, before and after I opened it); rather, it is apparently a renegade install program that deletes/corrupts some of Quake2's critical files! After trying to install Eraser 0.5 Quake2 was hosed!!! I could no longer run even the regular game. (The Eraser's install program on a previous version did the same thing to me. I had to completely re-install Quake2 that time!) The simple work-around is to re-install the q2-310.exe patch (Oops! It got corrupted too! But I had a backup. :-) After re-installing the 310 patch, everything works! I wish Ridah would forget the exe installs and go back to the regular zips."
>
> A couple of people have confirmed this being the case. We are yet to hear from Ridah, tho. I agree with Randar on the ".zip" downloads.
>
> Some people are reporting that McAfee detected a virus. McAfee v3.1.6 reports ANXIETY.POPPY.II.
>
> However, I don't believe it is a virus! The above explanation is the more likely scenario. More on this later.

And:

> VIRUS CONFIRMED! Eraser Bot v0.5 BETA (12:00 EST)\
> Richard Smith has this posted over at Redwood's. It is an apology for accidentally infecting Ridah with the virus that got attached to the Eraser Bot Install:
>
> "In regards to the Eraser Bot v0.5 install, sometimes a Quake 2 installation can be saved with a simple reinstallation, other times it cannot. The patch does not work either way giving a "missing file container" error.
>
> Windows 95 loads up sometimes with no problems, other times with crashes and hangs. There is no pattern to this. Invalid Page Faults and Illegal instructions, 0E errors and more are also all common.
>
> I know this becuase it appears to be my machine that this started on. Ridah recently downloaded a test version of my program QBS from me which caused these problems on his system, meaning he had to re-install. The virus must have survived this and infected the Eraser download.
>
> I had no idea that a virus was contained in the QBS file, my computer has been having problems for more than a month but McAfee and PC Scan showed nothing so I concluded that it was a problem with one of my software packages and not a virus.
>
> I have lost loads of files and have agonised over this problem for weeks, Ridah has had to restart his, Mr Wolf is also one of many who has also watched his system disappear.
>
> I ask that Ridah is not blamed for these recent turn of events as he had no idea what he was letting himself in for when he downloaded QBS, he was doing me a favour and testing it after all. The Eraser bot is a fantastic add-on, Quake Rally was also great and Ridah will continue to provide great software for the Quake community.
>
> I only wish all this could have been avoided. When QBS is finally released to the public, I will be doing my upmost to make sure this doesn't happen again. I released the test version to four people to iron out early bugs and this is the result. A lot of people have lost a time, files and their system set up. More importantly they may have lost confidence in a developer who had no idea of the problems he was causing - Ridah. This should not happen.
>
> I cannot apologise enough.
>
> -Richard"
>
> We are still waiting for a report from Ridah...

And:

> Ridah Confirms Virus (12:30 EST)\
> Ridah (Eraser Bot Author), has confirmed that the distribution was infected with a virus. Here's what he posted over at impact.frag:
>
>> "Those that have downloaded the Eraser v0.5 and have run the installer, will no doubt be aware that it contained a virus. All I can say, is I am deeply sorry, and disturbed that my supposedly top-notch virus scanners, McAffee & VET (used by the Australian Government), were unable to detect the virus (I scanned my entire system before uploading the Installer, using both programs). I believe this virus attaches itself to .exe files, rendering them useless (which would explain a lot of the problems I've been having lately). So for most users, a reinstallation of Quake2 will be required. I am told that Norton Antivirus 95 will detect the virus, but I am unsure whether it will actually clean the infected files (I am downloading the update right now from Symantec's website).
>
> Once again, I would like to express my sincere apologies to any users that have exprienced problems related to the Eraser Installer. I guess there's one thing I've learnt about this, is that you can never use enough virus scanners.
>
> I have removed the infected installer from our files section, and would ask that all other webmasters which have mirrored the file, please do the same. I will have a new Installer available soon, once I can guarantee it's integrity."

> UPDATE: If you have used the Eraser Installer, then you have the Anxiety.II.1600 virus. The good news, is Norton's Antivirus for Win95 will clean most infected files, without having to delete them. BUT, you need the Virus list update, from Symantec's website.
If you don't have Norton's Anti-virus, there is a FREE trial-version available on the Symantec site, which comes with the latest files, which will completely remove the virus from your system.
>

>
> This is something I meant to mention earlier.. if you check out Redwood's 3D News you'll notice a public announcement from Richard Smith (of Hooded Claw, QBS fame) that he was the source of the virus. I had discovered this shortly after getting the NAV update, and was about to email him, when I saw the announcement, although I wasn't going to say anything publicly. So I'd just like to thank him for his kind words, and maturity in acknowledging his part in the preceedings. I downloaded his software and tried it at my own risk, therefore I cannot blame him for my actions. But it's nice to see him stand up and risk damaging his own integrity (although I think it actually says more that he's willing to publicly ackownledge his involvement), for sake of saving mine.

Available as a Win95/NT Installer (713 KB), a zip file (472 KB), and a Linux archive (which I won't mirror 'cause they always end up corrupted on my end). On the subject of the virusing, I received an email from the original source of the virus on Ridah's system, which I was asked to post as a public apology, so it's in the MailBag (having missed it myself, I certainly can't hold this against him, personally). Thanks to everyone who wrote in with words of understanding about posting that here (I presume the hate mail is delayed as people get their systems back on-line).

Mentioned on Impact News:

> Eraser v0.6, Request for help	. 	Thursday, 12/2/98

> Well it's now in a state that's releasable, but there are still some things I'm not happy about. The movement isn't as smooth as I'd like, and there are some other problems I noticed in testing, but I'm willing to put them aside, and give you something to play with while I sort out the non-essential things. Teamplay is there, zip/unzip is there to reduce the strain on disk space, latency simulation is there, and lots of other more insignificant changes/fixes. I've been a little under the weather lately (hence the erratic, and erroneous updates), so please be easy on the bug reports and suggestions. I like feedback, but I'd prefer sleep right now, if possible :).

> OK, the installer is fixed and has been re-uploaded. It turns out the files were in there, but the installer didn't get to extract them all. I'd really appreciate it, if you could mention this to any news pages that have mirrored the installer. Thanks.

> Eraser 0.6 Update\
> A new version 0.6b Eraser Bot installer (993 KB) is up on the Impact Development Team page that fixes a problem in the original installer from yesterday (if you downloaded the zip, you did not have this problem). Thanks (LoA)Lord Nightmare. There is also a note on how to implement the simulated lag:
>
>> Oh yeh, I forgot to document the push_latency stuff.. to give yourself some lag, just type "cmd lag n", where n is the number of milliseconds of lag, from 0 to 1000.

## v0.7

Released as:

* `Eraser0304.exe`
* `Eraser0304.zip`

Mentioned on BluesNews:

> Tuesday, March 3, 1998
>
> New Eraser Bot\
> Ridah has posted version 0.7 of the Eraser Bot (thanks Redwood) as a Win95 Installer (1.1 MB), and a zip file (1.0 MB) with a bunch of new features, including  what sounds like really nifty new team AI. The post on the Impact Development Team says this may be the final version of the Eraser, teasing an announcement:
>
>> Get ready to lead your team to victory! The Advanced Squadron AI has really come off better than I expected it to be. This changes the game drastically, as you'll now find team games are more of a "team game". Don't be surprised if you find yourself in a stand-off against the other team, who's guarding the Rocket Launcher, or Quad. I've included some new teams, with 8 players on each squad, boys vs. girls, so bump up the players_per_team to 8 and away you go. See bots.cfg for the names of these teams. Tip: press G to form a new squadron.
>>
>> A lot of work has gone into this version, which should result in a much faster game, more intelligent AI, and the ability to play with more bots.
>>
>> Please see the readme.txt for information on how to use the new Advanced Squadron AI and how to modify the new configurable chat system.
>>
>> Eraser Bot v0.7
>>
>> * Advanced Squadron AI
>> * Increased Intelligence
>> * Faster AI System (play against more bots!)
>> * Configurable Chat System
>> * Automatic Disabling/Enabling of Dynamic Routing
>> * see EraserTodo.txt for complete list of changes

* [Beta .7 Eraser Bot](https://web.archive.org/web/19991021225716/http://ogr.com/columns/modzone/modzone_bot.shtml)

Mentioned on Redwoods:

> March 03, 1998
>
> Eraser Bot v0.7 Released\
> Ridah has released, what is expected to be the last major revision of the Eraser Bot, version 0.7, on the Impact page. Download the self extracting eraser0304.exe (1078K - Stomped) or the zipped, eraser0304.zip (1056K - Stomped). Ridah just started work elsewhere so he won't have time to add any MAJOR features to the bot anymore. Don't worry, this won't be another Reaper Bot. Ridah will be releasing the source code shortly. The AI system is supposed to be better and faster (i.e. more bots) and there is now advanced squadron AI. Oh, and yes, I scanned this one for viruses. :)

> Eraser 0.7\
> Ridah has released Eraser 0.7. This is probably one of the last major releases of the bot. Anyway there are two versions available. The Win95 Installer and a zipped version. The .zip is only 30Kb smaller this time.

Released as:

> New Eraser - CTF Support\
> Version 0.8 of the Eraser Bot is up on the Impact Development Team page as an installer (2.2 MB) or a zip (2.1 MB) featuring Capture the Flag support, though the bots don't grapple in this version (requires CTF pack), and Viewable Weapons support (requires the View Weapons pack). Also, Grimlock sent along a pack of 10 eraser skins (637 KB) that he put together, apparently a couple of the new skins in the Eraser distribution are from this pack.

> Eraser Bot .8 with CTF Support!\
> Ridah has released the Eraser Bot .8 beta on the Impact page. New features include CTF and viewable weapons support (provided you have those mods already). Too bad he couldn't get the grapple easily working in CTF. There are of course bug fixes as well (.7 had some crashing problems). Anyway, I mirrored the files. Get eraser0312.exe (2216K - Stomped) for the Win95 installer or zip - eraser0312.zip (2194K - Stomped).

> Wow, that was quick. Must've been some serious bugs because Ridah just posted the Eraser Bot .81 on the Impact page. Don't worry, if you downloaded .80 this morning, there is a zipped patch from .8 (183K - Stomped) and an installer patch (205K - Stomped). For the full version download either the Win95 Installer (2216K - Stomped) or get the Zipped (2194K - Stomped) version. Check the ToDo List for the fixes/additions. If you have .80, you will want to update to .81.

You can download the v0.8 to v0.81 upgrade here or the complete v0.81 here. If you are confused go to the downloads page to see what you can sponge.

> On a slightly unrelated matter, has anyone had any problems with eraser 0.85, specifically the bots seem to get stuck in the same places each time and in CTF the bots generally stay in the other teams base resulting in stalemate. I have got extremely good route-tables so I don't think that's the problem. So if anyone has seen the same problems mail me.

>> * Tweaked teamplay grouping, so as not to form new groups too often, breaking current groups
>> * Fixed Bot starting a group, and not hanging around long enough to form the team
>> * Fixed standing around, walking into walls in certain maps. This was the new button trigger code playing up, so it should have only worked on maps with buttons (route files made with v0.85 should work fine). Added tips section to readme.txt for making good clean route files.
>>
>> Warning: new bots.cfg (fixes View Weapons problems) and chat.txt (typo fix) files are included in this patch. You can backup your old files and copy back the relevant information, but you must use these new files as a base, since the old files contained errors.

I have mirrored the files for everybody. For the FULL version download the .9 Win32 Installer (2788K - Stomped), or the .9 zip (2766K - Stomped). There is also a patch from .85, get the Win32 Installer patch (1157K - Stomped) or the zipped patch. Remember, if you get the zip, unzip to your Quake2 directory using restore folder names. Also, if upgrading, you need to rename your .zip route files to .zipped.

> Eraser Bot v0.9 Released!!!\
> Ridah has released v0.9 of the Eraser Bot! Mostly a bug fix with a few speed improvements and Teamplay/CTF enhancements.. You can download the full version here (2.8Mb) or get the patch (1.1Mb). Below are the details of the fix:
>
> * Fix Greeting chats
> * Save zips as .zipped, to avoid Zip-Folders from scewing around with them
> * CTF defend/attack logic with uneven teams
> * Changing maps on server, humans on incorrect CTF teams
> * Bots don't go for tech's
> * Only do teleport if they want to
> * Keep some bots back at base (when flag taken) if possible
> * Doors in jail1 don't open by bots
> * Rocket avoidance too predictable
> * Continuous telefrags at intermission
> * Friendly fire during teamplay
> * Bots more aggressively pursue enemy flag carrier
> * When using ViewWeapons, and spawning random bots, try to pick bots that are supported
> * Bots should go for tech's more often
> * Check that flag_path_src has it's destination paths setup in q2ctf1
> * Bots not getting weapons when defending?
> * Allow multiple paths back to base
> * Fixed moving too fast while swimming
> * NODES: Ignore Rocket Jumping
> * View weapons only work with teamplay ON
> * Don't suicide at intermission screen
> * Don't respawn after fraglimit has been hit
> * Bots firing into walls on CTF3, camping in wierd places
> * Big speed improvements on large levels
> * Railgun "fuzzy" aiming was broken in v0.86
> * Fixed strafe jumping into lava
> * Added some more chat lines
> * Here's another note from Ridah:
>
> "NOTE: If you're upgrading from and older version, you should rename all .zip files in the eraser\routes directory to .zipped. This is to avoid a nasty problem caused by a VERY LAME program called ZipFolders which prevents Win32 programs from accessing .zip files. To do this, simply open up a Dos Shell, change to the eraser\routes directory, then type:
>
> ren \*.zip \*.zipped

> The Eraser can still read .zip files, but will only save them as .zipped, so unless you rename them, you'll end up with duplicate files, and hence be wasting space on your Hard Drive."

>> * AI fixes, etc
>> * Smaller routes
>> * Grapple usage
>> * New CAM mode, check readme.txt file for instructions (thanks to Paul Jordan for the CAM code)
>> * New sentiant abilites: bots are conscious of their own existance, and will act accordingly
>> * Injuries: bots will limp after sustaining a non-mortal wound
>> * Pre-game chat lounge, where you can get to know other bots before killing each other (it's common courtesy!)
>> * Bots now have "llama" abilities. A bot with a high llama rating will be more likely to flood the game with annoying text, or sit around talking about the latest PPM's while you try to protect the flag
>> * Bots now have simulated bugs. Any problems experienced with this version are the result of hours of research and programming.
>> * Eraser will now auto-detect anyone that failed to detect the humour in the above features, spanking them to the ground upon loading any map beginning with a T.

>> I've fixed a bunch of problems, most notably the persistant green line. I've also enhanced the grapple use per user request, made some major tweaks to the Camera, lots of movement AI fixes, although some still remain (they take the longest to fix).

The new version includes bug fixes and a couple of new touches, like a simulated pause key.

> Eraser Bot .98 Released\
> The Impact page has been updated with the new Eraser Bot .98. You must have .97 to use the patch. Download the Win32 Installer .98 Patch or the Zipped .98 Patch. Here are the changes:
>
>> * Fixed level progression crashes
>> * Better button handling
>> * NODES: One-way trigger_push brushes (don't drop reverse jump nodes)
>> * mapmod_random cvar (random map progression)
>> * bot_tarzan cvar (toggle bot's "advanced" use of grapple)
>> * botpause, simulated pause (since PAUSE doesn't work during deathmatch)
>
> The source code will be released later tonight.

> Eraser .991\
> The Impact page has the Eraser Bot version .991 available. This one came out while I was at E3 but still wanted to mention it because some people still probably haven't heard about it. I haven't tried it yet, nor can I upload it until later tonight, but here is a list of problems (thanks MuuMuu):
>
>> * Chaingun and MachineGun aiming is broken
>> * Bots will stand when they shouldn't be able to, resulting in them getting stuck and eventually suiciding
>> * The linux version included zipped routes, when linux is unable to extract them, so they need to be manually unzipped before they will be used

Mentioned on Impact News:

> Final Eraser (finally)	. 	Friday 21/8/98
>
> It's finally here.
>
> I've fixed a tonne of bugs, tweaked things here and there, added things here and there. This is the last release of the Eraser bot, unless we managed to overlook any major problems (please don't email me unless you're REALLY sure it's a large bug).
>
> This version has been largely tweaked for CTF play, with HUGE improvements over previous versions. Not only are they smarter, and more cohesive with the rest of the team, but they'll respond to your every command. With the following keys (you must bind these yourself):
>
> R - Rushbase\
> D - Defendbase\
> F - Freestyle
>
> You have total control over your (bot) squadron, which gives the game a very strategic feel. If you fancy yourself on defense, just sit back and send them all to the enemy flag, or vice-versa.
>
> I strongly recommend that if you haven't tried this functionality, or haven't tried (Eraser) CTF at all, then do yourself a favour, and give it a shot. This has occupied easily 80% of my total Eraser coding time, so while Eraser is a deathmatching graduate, it has "majored" in CTF.

> The Final Eraser Bot  [11:04 AM EDT]\
> What's expected to be the final release of the Eraser bot for Quake II, version 1.0, is up on the Impact Development Team page. The new Eraser offers many tweaks to Capture the Flag, comes with a full installer, and version 2.23 of the Quick Start Eraser Bot Wizard for ease of configuration. Thanks Redwood.

Here are some local links, thanks to our fine  friends at GamesNET: The full Eraser Installer with Launcher (8.0 MB), the Eraser installer with no launcher (2.5 MB), and the no-frills zip version (2.5 MB).

> Ridah has updated his .plan with word on the Eraser Bot 1.0 status, saying it should only be a few days away now.

>> Testing, testing, testing... Final Eraser is on it's way, and will be much improved over any previous versions. I have really been honing in on the CTF play, and having a blast at the same time. You now have full control over your teammates (bots), with RUSHBASE, DEFENDBASE and FREESTYLE (normal). This gives the game a very strategy-type feel, since when you issue these commands, they'll all drop what they're doing, and follow your command. So the fate of the game very much depends on your instructions.
>>
>> ETA, a few days, give or take.

> Eraser Bot 1.00 Released!\
> The moment many bot lovers have been waiting for is here. Ridah has released the Eraser Bot, version 1.00 FINAL over on the Impact page. Download the Win32 Installer Eraser Bot 1.00 FINAL without Launcher (2607K), Zipped Eraser Bot 1.00 FINAL without Launcher (2585K - unzip to Quake2 directory using folders!), the Win32 Installer Eraser Bot 1.00 FINAL WITH Launcher (8212K). Yes, that is the last file size is correct, it's very big. If you're comfortable using the Eraser Bot without the launcher already, then you don't need to get that one. The Source code is also available. Ridah scanned these with the latest McAfee virus scanner and I scanned them with the 8/12 Norton Antivirus update so hopefully they are safe. :o) Here is what Ridah had to say about this final release.
>
>> I've fixed a tonne of bugs, tweaked things here and there, added things here and there. This is the last release of the Eraser bot, unless we managed to overlook any major problems (please don't email me unless you're REALLY sure it's a large bug).
>>
>> This version has been largely tweaked for CTF play, with HUGE improvements over previous versions. Not only are they smarter, and more cohesive with the rest of the team, but they'll respond to your every command. With the following keys (you must bind these yourself):
>>
>> * R - Rushbase
>> * D - Defendbase
>> * F - Freestyle
>>
>> You have total control over your (bot) squadron, which gives the game a very strategic feel. If you fancy yourself on defense, just sit back and send them all to the enemy flag, or vice-versa.
>>
>> I strongly recommend that if you haven't tried this functionality, or haven't tried (Eraser) CTF at all, then do yourself a favour, and give it a shot. This has occupied easily 80% of my total Eraser coding time, so while Eraser is a deathmatching graduate, it has "majored" in CTF.

>
> Eraser v1.01 is now available. This is the absolute last release of the Eraser (from me anyway).
>
> The patch for QuickStart (which was causing Eraser crashes when selecting individual bots) can be found here. This is included in the Full v1.01 release.
>
> This fixes the View Weapon problems (it now uses the built-in view weapon support) and fixes a CTF bug, which caused the defendbase command to stop your (bot) teammates from chasing enemies after they grab the flag.
>
> Note that you no longer need to keep a list of view weapons models in the bots.cfg file, thats all handled automatically by the engine.

> Final Eraser  [12:37 PM EDT]\
> Impact Development Team has word of the release of the Eraser Bot version 1.01, which Ridah says will be the last release from him off the Eraser, the Quake II bot. This will also mark the last update from Ridah to the Impact page (remember he's working for Xatrix now), capping his notes with some very kind words for his hosts at Frag.Com. The new release fixes some VWep problems and a bug with CTF support, as well as a problem with QuickStart. Here's a local copy of the full installer (8.0 MB), the no-launcher installer (2.0 MB), the zipped version, the patch to upgrade from 1.0, the Solaris ports, and the source code also available on the Impact site.

> id's Anna Kang sends along an announcement about their upcoming Quake II add-on, Extremities, that answers some questions about the pack, including what mods will be included. She also sent along a .jpg of the box art.
>
>> Just wanted to drop a line that we're nearing the final packaging design for Extremities. Activision has been very supportive of our efforts and Focus2 has created some of the coolest designs for this compilation. Extremities will introduce many people to the works of some very talented authors. We hope this cooperative effort will be the first in a line of products that increases public awareness of the Quake online community. We've gotten great responses from the mod authors. Each of the chosen authors will be receiving royalties in addition to the well deserved credit for their great efforts. We are all looking forward to the release of Extremities.
>>
>> The following is the list of contributors to Extremities: Player models and skins by: Rowan "Sumaleth" Crawford Deathmatch Maps by: Sten 'Ztn' Uusvali and Daniel 'Trebz' Nolan
>>
>> The mods: - QWar2 - Kick - Capture! - PowerBall - Rail Arena - Red Rover - Rocket Arena 2 - Action Quake 2 - Eraser Bot by Ridah - Jailbreak by Team Reaction - C.H.A.O.S. Deathmatch by Chaotic Dreams
>>
>> CTF will be included with the latest patch update of Quake II.
