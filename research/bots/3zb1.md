> Who's up for a new bot? Well get your hands on the *Stupid Bot* (it's far from it) by Ponpoko. This is a very good bot and I recommend you download it. Word of warning, all bar the base instructions are in Japanese. It hasn't caused any problems with my Q2. Here is the link. Enjoy it.

Reviewed on Inside3d:

> Saturday 14th Feb '98 GMT

> Stupid Bot Update\
> Legion made some comments on the Stupid Bot on Inside3d basically saying the bot was amazingly easy to play. I wondered what he was going on about, then I saw he was playing on the highest skill. For some reason on the highest skill the bot is amazingly poor, keep to skill 1 (the default) and it should be much better. Should have put this in yesterday.
