> Who's up for a new bot? Well get your hands on the *Stupid Bot* (it's far from it) by Ponpoko. This is a very good bot and I recommend you download it. Word of warning, all bar the base instructions are in Japanese. It hasn't caused any problems with my Q2. Here is the link. Enjoy it.

> Legion made some comments on the Stupid Bot on Inside3d basically saying the bot was amazingly easy to play. I wondered what he was going on about, then I saw he was playing on the highest skill. For some reason on the highest skill the bot is amazingly poor, keep to skill 1 (the default) and it should be much better. Should have put this in yesterday.

> Epidemic has posted Ponpoko's "Stupid Bot" up for download. Go check it out.
Update: I just tried out "Stupid Bot". I played it 1-on-1 on base1 at highest skill levels. The bot can pick up all items including the quad. Yes, this means it can crouch, too. However, it never picked up the RL, never decided to swim at all so it didn't get the BFG, etc. (A common problem among all the bots I've tried.) It only picked up the green armor once. Never got the gold armor. Does not like to fight which is a bad thing for a bot. It does strafe but it doesn't like to fire its weapon. When it "runs", it doesn't seem to run as fast as a player can. After 20 mins, I won 15 - 0. The game was not as close as the score suggested. Although I don't think this bot ever missed a shot (when it finally takes one), I spent most of my time trying to look for the bot. This wastes time. I had over 150+ health and 120+ armor when the game ended. I also had full ammo, of course. All but one frag was earned by using the super shotgun. The lone non-shotgun kill was by using a rocket launcher. Oh, watch out for a bot that has the quad. It seems like "one shot" removes all your armor. How does this compare to the Famke bot? I don't know. I've never tried the Famke bot. If you think Famke bot was a little too tough, then you might want to consider this. I played it on highest skill level so I imagine it is even easier on skill 0.

> On a related note, Ponpoko also has some tutorials up on his site on Quake 2 programming. The tutorials are in Japanese which shouldn't be too much of a problem if you know Japanese.

> Cube e-mailed me this concerning the Stupidbot:
>
>> On the Stupid, the highest skill is screwed, try it on skill 1 and seems to work properly.
>
> I received the e-mail last Sat. but today I finally got a chance to play the stupid bot at skill 1. I still won by a score of 11-0. However, this score doesn't reflect how much more difficult the bot is at skill 1. So I recorded a demo showing off its skills. After playing the bot twice (one at higher skill the other day and one today), I do not recognize any dynamic learning. However, its ability to recognize the environment and locate things is top notch. This was obvious the first time around when I saw it glowing in blue. This can only mean that it picked the quad and it had to crouch to get it. In the demo, you can now see the bot pick up the rocket launcher as well. In this 20 minute DM, the bot picked up the RL at least twice that I know about. It doesn't seem to be able to swim, however, but then again it didn't try, either. The demo shows the bot killing me once but it killed itself once so its final score was zero. Click here to download the demo. Two of my kills were "cheap" kills. The bot was stuck in two places. I killed it once or twice with the RL as well. I missed badly with my one attempt in using the BFG. The other kills were all by the supershotgun. I'm not very good with it, however, but good enough to beat stupidbot with it. Unlike the eraserbot, I've rarely seen this bot ever go after the supershotgun. It seems by bad luck, it never respawns anywhere close to the supershotgun.
>
> Update: I just read over at Quake2 Epidemic that version 0.99f of StupidBot has been released. Looks like quite a few changes were made in the last three days or so. The version of Stupidbot I played was v0.99d. The skill level problem was fixed in this new version.
