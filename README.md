# Quake II Bot Archive

The goal of this project is to archive **all versions** of **all Quake II bots**.

## About

Quake II is a computer game released by id Software in late 1997. The source code that controls the game was released shortly after.

Bots represent a historical breakthrough in computer game artificial intelligence (e.g. opponents that act like human players) and are also a lot of fun to play (e.g. a multiplayer game that can be enjoyed as a single player game).

This project seeks to (1) **locate**, (2) **archive**, and (3) **host** all versions of all Quake 2 bots in their original distributed form.

If you have backups of old Quake 2 bots, [you can help](#Help).

## Help

Perhaps you can help to make this archive more complete.

* Do you have a copy of a missing Quake 2 bot file?
* Do you know about a Quake 2 bot missing from the archive?
* Do you know a Quake 2 bot author's real name or how to contact them?

Please email Jason Brownlee via jason.brownlee05@gmail.com

Even if you have bot files already in the archive, send them through. Many bots were released with the same filename again and again.
